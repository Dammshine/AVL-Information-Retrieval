In March 1992, following the release of her first and second studio albums Mariah Carey (1990) and Emotions (1991), Mariah Carey performed a concert on the American television program MTV Unplugged.[9] As she had not toured, Carey sought to establish herself as a capable live performer and disprove notions by critics that her voice was manufactured in a studio.[10] After the concert was well received by her fans and critics alike, Carey's record label—Columbia—released it as an extended play, MTV Unplugged. Its first single, "I'll Be There", became her sixth number-one song on the United States Billboard Hot 100 chart.[11]Rather than being sold, 4,500 tickets for the event were distributed by Carey's fan club, local radio stations, and those with connections to the production. Several rows closest to the stage were reserved for fan club members, and two rows in the middle section were removed for a camera dolly.[19] Most of the filming at Proctor's occurred over two nights on July 15 and 16, 1993, with nine cameras using 35mm film.[16][17] Carey performed the same set list on each night, and performances from both were used for the video.[19] Her performance of "I'll Be There" with 40 children from the Albany Police Athletic League on stage took place beforehand on July 14.[20] Non-concert footage was primarily filmed at Carey's New York estate.[21] Lawrence Jordan—who directed Carey's MTV Unplugged performance and music videos for "Someday" and "I Don't Wanna Cry"[22][23]—also directed Here Is Mariah Carey.[24] Due to her fans' presence, Carey considered the video's production the first time she realized her level of fame.[25]
Here Is Mariah Carey was first shown on November 25, 1993, on NBC.[7] As it aired in the November sweeps period, during which Nielsen ratings are used to determine advertisement prices for subsequent months, Richard Huff of the New York Daily News thought this suggested NBC believed it would draw a large audience.[28] Here Is Mariah Carey received 19 million viewers and a rating and share of 11.0/21, meaning 11 percent of American households with a television watched the program, and 21 percent with one in use were tuned in to the special.[29][30] Out of the primetime network programs, it ranked third for the night,[29] 34th for the week,[29] and fifth among entertainment specials aired during November sweeps.[31] Sales of Music Box resulting from the broadcast caused the album to reach number one on the Billboard 200 chart for the first time.[32] Outside the United States, the special was broadcast in Australia,[33] Canada,[34] and the United Kingdom.[35]

Columbia Music Video released Here Is Mariah Carey on VHS in the United States on November 30, 1993.[2][36] Releases in the United Kingdom and France followed in February 1994,[3][4] and a DVD in 2006.[37] It marked Carey's third video release, following The First Vision (1991) and MTV Unplugged +3 (1992).[38] The video is approximately one hour long[1] and includes more non-concert footage plus the "Dreamlover" music video, which were not shown on the NBC broadcast.[24][39] Sony Pictures Entertainment released it for digital download and rental worldwide on December 7, 2021.[40] Performances from the concert received releases independent of the Here Is Mariah Carey video. In 1993, Columbia released a CD maxi single of "Hero" which includes audio of Carey's Proctor's Theater performance of the song as the second track.[41] The following year, the label released it as a standalone promotional CD single.[42] In 1994, that of "Dreamlover" was included on certain CD singles and twelve-inch singles alongside "Without You" and "Never Forget You".[43][44] It was later included on a digital maxi single with other versions of the song.[45] Carey's perform
Two set designs which are meant to create an operatic yet funky atmosphere adorn the stage for the concert. The first act features monolithic abstract shapes inspired by Boris Aronson's sculptures in the 1958 Broadway production of The Firstborn that are colored blue-gray to complement Carey's skin tone, and the second features several fabrics and drapery. Both include openings that allow light to protrude while a painted cyclorama acts as a background. Platforms of varying heights and wrought iron railings inspired by those of Josep Maria Jujol are also present. An earlier set design plan which called for a revolving stage that would mechanically rotate between the two acts was changed due to camera and budget limitations.[17] The band—which has a near-identical composition to the one in Carey's MTV Unplugged performance—is situated on the left side of the stage while the background singers are on the right, standing in front of the string players.[26]
"Dreamlover" is a song recorded by American singer-songwriter, and record producer Mariah Carey, released on July 27, 1993, as the lead single from her third studio album, Music Box (1993). Its lyrics were written by Carey, with music composed by Carey and Dave Hall, and was produced by Carey, Walter Afanasieff and Hall. The song incorporates a sample of the hook from "Blind Alley" by the Emotions, previously used in "Ain't No Half-Steppin'" (1988) by Big Daddy Kane, into its melody and instrumentation. "Dreamlover" marked a more pronounced attempt on Carey's part to incorporate hip hop into her music, as was seen in her decision to work with Hall, who had previously produced What's the 411? (1992) by Mary J Blige.[1] This was partly in light of the mixed reception to her previous studio effort Emotions (1991), which featured gospel and 1960s soul influences. Lyrically, the song pictures a protagonist calling for a perfect lover, her "dreamlover," to whisk her away into the night and not "disillusion" her like others in the past.

"Dreamlover" received positive reviews from contemporary music critics, many of whom praised the song's incorporated sample, as well as Carey's carefree vocal style. The song was the first of several of her lead singles that sampled older tunes as a musical bed, as seen in "Fantasy" (1995), "Honey" (1997), "Heartbreaker" (1999), and "Loverboy" (2001). It was a global success, becoming Carey's seventh chart topper on the US Billboard Hot 100, remaining there for eight weeks. It peaked at number one in Canada and became a top-ten hit in Australia, the Netherlands, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom.

Carey performed "Dreamlover" live on several televised talk shows around the world, including The Arsenio Hall Show in September 1993, the British music chart program Top of the Pops, and the 1993 Music Fair in Japan. In 1999, following the release of Carey's Rainbow, the song was included in the Mariah Carey Homecoming Special, and her appearance on The Today Show. Additionally, "Dreamlover" was featured in the set-lists of most of her succeeding tours, making its debut on the Music Box Tour (1993). The song was included on Carey's compilation albums, #1's (1998), Greatest Hits (2001), and #1 to Infinity (2015). The European B-side "Do You Think Of Me" is included in the compilation album The Rarities (2020).

The song's music video was filmed by Diane Martel in Copake, in upstate New York, in June 1993. It includes an appearance by Carey's dog Jack, and shows Carey dancing in a flowerbed and field, swimming in a large pond, boarding a hot air balloon, and dancing alongside several shirtless male dancers. According to author Chris Nickson, the video's carefree setting harmonized well with the song's soft instrumentation. Due to the song's strong radio airplay and extended charting, the video received frequent play on several music video channels throughout the summer of 1993.
By the second quarter of 1993, Carey completed recording material for her third album, Music Box.[12][13] Before its release later that year, her management team negotiated a deal with NBC for a one-hour television special, Here Is Mariah Carey,[a] to promote the album. The show would allow Carey to warm up for her forthcoming Music Box Tour, reach an audience unable to see her on a tour date, and give Columbia the ability to release it as a video album in time for the 1993 Christmas shopping season.[14][15] To select a venue for the taping, a Sony Music production crew evaluated almost two dozen theaters in four U.S. states.[16] They chose the 2,700-seat Proctor's Theatre in Schenectady, New York, for its grand architecture, strong acoustics, and proximity to Carey's house with newlywed husband Tommy Mottola.[17] In a chapter from her 2020 memoir The Meaning of Mariah Carey, Carey states that she disagreed with the choice: "Even though it was a beautiful, classic theater, it was not the setting I would have chosen, to be sure; nor would most twenty-year-olds in the early 1990s."[18]
